**gcmfaces** is a Matlab toolbox designed to handle results of [MITgcm][] ocean simulations such as [ECCO v4 r2][] and earth variables more generally (Forget et al 2015). It allows users to seamlessly deal with various gridding approaches (e.g., all grids distributed via <ftp://mit.ecco-group.org/ecco_for_las/version_4/grids/grids_input/>) using compact and generic codes as explained in the user guide ([gcmfaces.pdf][]). It includes many basic and more evolved functionalities for plotting global maps, computing transports and budgets, etc. as illustrated by [gcmfaces_demo.m][] and the standard analysis (see Forget et al., 2015, 2016).
