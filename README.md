**gcmfaces** is a Matlab toolbox designed to handle results of [MITgcm][] ocean simulations and gridded earth variables more generally (Forget et al., 2015). It allows users to seamlessly deal with various gridding approaches using compact and generic codes as explained in the [gcmfaces.pdf][] user guide. It includes many basic and more evolved functionalities such as plotting global maps, computing transports, and budgets.
