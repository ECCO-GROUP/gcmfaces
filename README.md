# gcmfaces
gcmfaces is a Matlab toolbox designed to handle gridded earth variables; results of MITgcm ocean simulations originally (Forget et al., 2015). It allows users to seamlessly deal with various gridding approaches using compact and generic codes as explained in the gcmfaces.pdf documentation. It includes many basic and more evolved functionalities such as plotting global maps, computing transports, and budgets. Forget, G., J.-M. Campin, P. Heimbach, C. N. Hill, R. M. Ponte, and C.
