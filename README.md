**gcmfaces** is a Matlab toolbox designed to handle results of [MITgcm][] ocean simulations and earth variables on [various grids][] (Forget et al., 2015). It allows users to seamlessly deal with various gridding approaches using compact and generic codes as explained in the [gcmfaces.pdf][] user guide. It includes many basic and more evolved functionalities such as plotting global maps, computing transports, and budgets.
